# Tic-Tac-Toe

## By [Sunil Shastry](https://www.sunilshastry.com/ "Sunil Shastry")

_**Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple multiplayer game which is best preferred to play with a pencil and a paper between two players. This is an open-source Python application of Tic-Tac-Toe which takes a level above the actual game, a user can play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another user, or against the CPU. The main goal of this application is to provide a nice user experience on a console while performing all the important aspects of the game Tic-Tac-Toe.**_



## Installation and Setup



TicTacToe is designed and built using Python 3, it is recommend for the user to have Python 3.5 or a higher version of Python installed on their computer device. This is a console based application and consequently it is assumed that the user is aware of running a Python program on their console. However, if a person reading this is not aware of any basic command line interfaces (CLI), I have included a short reference below to get some idea on running the `main.py` Rhythm file (or any Python file in that regard).

Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python 3 for your device") to install Python 3 on to your device.

> To get started, open up your terminal or command prompt, and follow the given commands to familiarize yourself with the basic CLI commands.

#### Common Commands

- `pwd` _Print working directory (pwd)_ displays the path name of the current directory
- `cd` _Change directory (cd)_, changes from one folder to another. To enter a folder use `cd (foldername)` and to leave a folder use `cd ..`
- `ls` _List (ls)_ provides a list of all files with a directory
- `clear` _Clears_ information on the display screen to provide a blank slate

## Required Packages

The project is built using the Python 3 programming language and uses the following libraries:

- `random` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
- `TicTacToe` (No need to install, found in the project)
- `User` (No need to install, found in the project)
- `CPU` (No need to install, found in the project)
- `Greet` (No need to install, found in the project)

**In order to have the TicTacToe work for the CPU version of the game, you must have the `random` module installed, the rest are automatically downloaded with the project.**

If you **do not** wish to view the Python documentation to install the required libraries or if you simply find the documentation a little complicated or intimidating, here is a short method to install a Python library through your **command prompt** or **terminal**.

- `pip install <package-name>`
- `pip install random`



## How to Use TicTacToe?

Once you have downloaded and installed all the project files and the required Python module, head over to your terminal or command prompt. TicTacToe is primarily based on the console, one can use the application through their terminal or command prompt only. To run the project, navigate to the project directory using some [CLI commands](https://dev.to/kymiddleton/reference-guide-common-commands-for-terminal-6no) and run the following command.

```
python main.py
```

If you are using a Mac, the above command may or may not work since Mac comes with a Python 2 version pre-installed on it already. To tackle this issue, please try running the following command.

```
python3 main.py
```

A full reference about running Python on the command line can be found [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/running-a-python-script)

Once you run the above command TicTacToe starts the game, you can simply choose to navigate and play the game according to your will. The game has two options: you can either play against another user or, you can play against the CPU. While playing please remember to check the details and the rules of the game if not aware of it already, all the prerequisite details can be easily accessed via `helper.py` file.

To view the details in `helper.py` file, type the following command on your terminal/command prompt.

```
python helper.py
```

â€¦and on Mac,

```
python3 helper.py
```
